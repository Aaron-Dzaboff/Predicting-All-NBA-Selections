## Project Title

Predicting All-NBA Selections :basketball:

## Description

This is a mini-project to try and predict who will be named to the All-NBA teams at the end of the 2019-2020 season.
The project's focus was to ultize the different machine learning methods to see how the results differ. 
**This project has some short falls.** The first being that I have not scaled the numbers to project as end-of-the-season statistics.
Also, the players need to broken into _1st, 2nd, and 3rd team selections_. Finally, there could be more statistics added in to help aid the models.
